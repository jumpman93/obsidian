 # [[Chapter 6 - Hearing]]

### lecture outline / learning goals:

### examples:

### active recall study questions:
- how is are sound waves measured in loudness and [[pitch]]?
	- the [[amplitude]] and the [[frequency]] determine the loudness and how we perceived the sound, higher or lower pitch.
- what is the anatomy of the outer ear?
	- the [[pinna]] is the folds of the ***outer ear***, which are structured to amplify frequencies from the side and front, allowing us to locate where the sound is coming from.
	- the [[tympanic membrane (ear drum)]] vibrates when in contact with sound waves, processing the sound to the [[middle ear]]
- what is the anatomy of the [[middle ear]]?
	- three tiny bones called [[ossicles]], specifically [[malleus]], [[incus]] and [[stapes]] are connected like a mechanical chain, transfering the energy from the [[tympanic membrane (ear drum)]] to the [[inner ear]].
- what is the anatomy of the [[inner ear]]?
	- the [[cochlea]] is a snail shell shaped structure made up of three liquid filled tubes.
		- the [[basilar membrane]] runs along the [[cochlea]] and vibrates according to the oval windows vibrating the fluid waves.
			- the [[basilar membrane]] is a long membrane that starts small and tight and ends up big and floppier at the end, vibrating higher or lower frequencies along the membrane
				- the ***basal end*** vibrates in response to higher frequencies
				- the ***apical end*** vibrates in response to lower frequencies
	- the [[inner ear hairs]] take the energy from the [[basilar membrane]] and release neurotransmitters to the auditory nerve. 
		- one side of the cell is called the hair bundle, which reacts to the motion of the [[basilar membrane]] and the other is connected to a nerve which sends signals to the [[auditory nerve]]
		- by reacting to the motion of the [[basilar membrane]] the inner hairs move in tandem, compressing the [[tiplink]] causing [[hyperpolarization]], when they swing to the other direction, the [[tiplink]] stretch out causing depolarization allowing ***K+*** channels to open up, passing ***K+*** ions into the cell. Which opens up ***Ca2+*** channels, which open the [[vesicles]] holding the [[neuro transmitters]].
- the [[basilar membrane]] helps sharpen the frequencies by isolating them, but further sharpening is done by the [[organ of corti]] which lies on top of the [[basilar membrane]].
	- the [[organ of corti]] is packed with [[outer hair cells]] which run parallel to the [[inner ear hairs]], they are lodged into the [[basilar membrane]] and the hair bundles are connected to the [[tectorial membrane]].
	- the [[outer hair cells]] vibrate directly in response to the [[basilar membrane]] and can increase the sound frequencies amplitude by this motion.
		- due to the tonotopic nature of the [[basilar membrane]] and how the [[outer hair cells]] are positioned along the [[basilar membrane]], it allows for complex sound frequencies to be broken down and amplified, making the whole system more fine-tuned. 
		- also due to the position of the [[outer hair cells]], electrical signals can be associated with specific sound frequencies amplified by the [[outer hair cells]].
- what are the organs that transmute the auditory information to the auditory cortex?
	- the [[auditory nerve (cochlear nerve)]] connected the [[inner ear hairs]] to the [[cohlear nuclei]] through afferent fibers. 
	- the tonotopic nature of the [[basilar membrane]] allows for a labeled line coding, where each hair's reaction to different frequencies transcodes a specific stimulus to the [[auditory nerve]].
		- the auditory then goes to the [[olivary nuclei]], then to the [[lateral lemniscus]] then, the [[inferior colliculus]] then [[medial genliculate nucleus]] then finally to the [[auditory cortex]] in the [[temporal lobes]].
- what damage would cause deafness?
	- damage to the inner our middle ear could prevent auditory transmission to be registered in the [[cochlea]], **(conduction deafness)**
	- or damage to the [[cochlea]] **(sensorineural deafness)**
	- hearing aids can amplify the sound to make severely damaged auditory structures to perceive them.
	- or cochlea implants.
- what would result from damage to auditory structures downstream from the inner ear?
	- damage to the primary auditory cortex would result in loss of audio localization
	- damage to higher areas of auditory cortex could loss the ability to understand human speech and auditory familiarity. 
- hoe do we localize sound?
	- [[interaural differences]] is the processing of measuring a sounds volume (interaural volume) and its timing (interaural timing, how long it takes to reach both sides of the ear.) 
		- by measuring both the timing and volume, we can localize where the sound is on the lateral (left, right, front) and the medial plane (front, above, back and below).
	- the input from both [[cochlea]] (in each ear) allow for auditory information to converge onto a group of cells, stimulating specific cells based on the [[interaural differences]]. This allows us to map the auditory spacial differences in 2D, allowing us to localize sound.
- how do we keep balance?
	- the [[vestibular system]] provides information about direction and movement within the head. Three ***semicircular canals*** sense head rotation and angular acceleration, and two [[otolith organs]] sense head tilt and linear acceleration. 
	- The direction is derived from the orientation in space the canals take, positioned orthogonal to each other, each ***Semicircular canal*** is 90degrees to on another.
		- the mechanism the [[vestibular system]] uses is suspended hair cells attached to the head floating in the canals, the otolith are not attached to the hair cells but respond to linear acceleration by the inertia produced by the changes in velocity.
			- as the otolith's move according to acceleration, the hair cells move correspondingly.
			- the otholith's are position to capture change in the horizontal and vertical planesgi
