### 2 Modes of Thinking

***FOCUSED MODE***
- being highly focused on a task

***DIFFUSE MODE***
- letting the mind wander to find better solutions


### Einstellunge Effect
- being consumed with a single idea of how to solve a problem, not allowing you to find other solutions 
- the use of ==Diffuse Mode== allows you to take a step back a look at problems from different angles
- alternative modes of focus allows you to come to different solutions

### Recalling Material
- instead of constantly reading material to understand, practice [[Active Recall]] to learn material

### Solving Problems and General
- do not look a solution of problems and move on, analyze the solution and understand the fundamentals. Then precede to solve another similar question.
- once you understand a concept move on to maximize learning time
- don't do questions in the same sequence
- use a timer when working on practice tests to simulate a real test, to accustom you to stress.
