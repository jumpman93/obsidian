### Notes :

***Chapter 2: Attention and Effort***
- [[System 1]] has a fundamental understanding of how the world operates and uses that knowledge to function, when it runs into trouble it calls on [[System 2]] to consciously process challenging information.
- [[System 2]] is responsible for self control
- [[Cognitive Illusions]] are initially impressions of things that [[System 1]] undertakes, that are not necessarily true. Due to the fact that [[System 1]] works 24/7 and can not be turned off, in order to avoid [[Cognitive Illusions]] we must use [[System 2]] to process information to come to a belief which we can reference in the future when faced with the same [[Cognitive Illusions]]. Having a hierarchy of importance is necessary as we can't consciously process everything.
- a cognitive baseline is in play until a task is required that proceeds the threshold. Pupil dilation can be used as a measure of cognitive difficultly. 
- cognitive operation tasks tend to max out the limits of [[System 2]]'s operational capacity, while compared to storing or recalling digits. (pg.36)
- [[Executive Control]] is the process of overriding innate behavior to perform a goal-directed behavior in conscious thought.
- psychologists have recently noted the difficultly of switching between two tasks while retaining a high level of attention and focus.
- time also plays a role in our cognitive ability to perform tasks
- [[Cognitive Load]] is a set cognitive effort required to perform various cognitive tasks, (eg; remembering a set of 7 digits). [[System 2]] can not exceed the effort required to do such a task.

***Chapter 3: The Lazy Controller***
- [[Ego Depletion]] is the decrease in self control when forced to do a task that require, cognitive, physical or social effort. In experiments done by [[Roy Baumesiter]] in which participants had to exert effort into a task that required self control. If asked to do another task, their ability to complete that task would become diminished. A hypothetical [[pool of effort]] that cognitive, physical and social tasks all draw effort from, will diminish sequential  difficult tasks.
- The difference between [[Ego Depletion]] and [[Cognitive Load]] is that more effort can be extended while doing a task that involves [[Ego Depletion]] while a threshold cannot be breached when undergoing a tasks that evolves [[Cognitive Load]]. (pg. 43)
- [[Ego Depletion]] is analogous to running as mental activity requiring self-control consumes [[glucose]] and a depleted level of ego can be replenished by consuming glucose just as running consumes glucose. (pg. 43)
- the hypothesis that glucose can replenish [[Ego Depletion]] can be seen by a study conducted in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Science]] where Israel judges that were reviewing parole were more likely to grant parole after eating a meal, and more likely to fall back to their default position of (denying parole) after extended periods of not eating. The authors showed a spike of 65% approval of parole after finishing a meal and a slow decline of approval, approaching zero following the meal. The authors conclude that it is a result of fatigue and hunger

***Chapter 4: The Associative Machine***
- [[Associative Thinking]] the [[System 1]] process of thinking that links things in sets and categories all linked in unconscious thought. Initially hypothesized in 
> An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding 
> Published 1748
> David Hume

- he stated three principles regarding thought: resemblance, contiguity in time and place and causality, further claiming that these links are built in the conscious mind. We now associate these connections in thought to be made in [[System 1]], not totally accessible by our conscious mind.
- [[Priming Effect]] is pre-association with a thing before asking the tailored question. (eg; saying the word food and asking someone to fill in the word SO_P, it is more likely the individual will say Soup then Soap)
- [[ideomotor effect]] - when and idea or concept primes a action
- the influence of priming can lead to unconscious change in how we think, voting done in a school drastically increases the likely hood of people to vote for policies increasing school funding. Priming subjects with money increases individualism, priming morality increases authorization thinking in participants.

***Chapter 5: Cognitive Ease*** 
- companies that invoke [[cognitive ease]] with easier to pronounce names do better when initially going public according to a servery done in Switzerland

***Chapter 6: Norms, Surprise and Causes
- we are predisposed to create intention and causation within things in our life. 
- a study by [[Fritz Heider]], [[Mary-Ann Simmel]] created a film with a large triangle, small triangle and a circle moving around a shape that looks like a schematic view of a house with an open door. Viewers after watching the short film, had the impression of the large triangle bullying the small triangle and the circle being terrified. The small triangle and circle join forces and defeat the bully. The viewers assigned characters to the inanimate objects and found conflict within moving shapes.

***Chapter 7: A Machine for Jumping to conclusions*** 
- [[The Halo Effect]] we tend to fill judge things not based upon passed knowledge, rather preconceived notions of the thing. (pg.82)
- the sequence in which we hear information is extremely influential in the way we perceive things.
