 # [[Formal definition of limits]]

## TLDR;
- a formal understanding and definition of limits mathematically.

## delta and epsilon
***If you can get $f(x)$ as close to $L+or-\epsilon$  by making $x$ as close to $c$***

   ***then***

***you can find a #$\delta$ within $L+or-\epsilon$ that is closer to L then $\delta$***
### Given $\epsilon > 0$
### we can find $\delta > 0$ such that if 
### $|x-c|<\delta=f(x)-L|<\epsilon$
