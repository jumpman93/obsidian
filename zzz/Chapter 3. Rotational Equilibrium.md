 # [[Chapter 3. Rotational Equilibrium]]

### lecture outline:

### examples:
***terminology***
- pivot point

### active recall study questions:

***Understanding Rotation***
- what is torque?
- what is a rigid body model vs particle model
- how is rotational equilibrium achieved
- how do the net forces acting on a object on a rotating force at equilibrium differ from a equilibrium force in a particle model?
- how do you measure the rotation of an object?
- how do you find the vector $r$ that was displaced from origin
	- take both origin $r$ and new $r$ and subtract where you end up from origin
- what is a rotation point of a non fixed object?
	- center of mass is the point at which an object is rotated from, when not fixed
- what is the vector $r$
