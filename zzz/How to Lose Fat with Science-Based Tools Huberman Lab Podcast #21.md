### 5 Pillars of Metabolism
- quality [[sleep]]
- getting 1000mmg of [[Essential Fatty Acids]]
    - cravings for sugar can be dulled down with proper intake of [[amino acids]] and [[Essential Fatty Acids]], the neurons can satisfy those cravings. [[Glutamine]] is a source of [[amino acids]] that has a wide range of health benefits.
- setting healthy [[micro biome]] by eating a fermented foods
- [[thyroid]] health can be supported by proper intakes of [[iodine]] (kelp) and [[selenium]] (1-3 Brazil Nuts)

### the nervous system
- the way our bodies interact with fat it through out neurons, changing the way our neurons respond to fat is the most important factor in losing fat.
- the nervous system is responsible for the mobilization of fat through local interaction with [[epinephrine]] and stored fat.

### Fat Mobilization and Oxidation
- fat first needs to be prepped into a state where it can be changed.
- [[subcutaneous fat]] is fat under the skin, and typically the fat that people want to lose. 
- stored fat has two parts, the [[fatty acid]] that is attached to [[Glycerol]]. To mobilize fat you want to break the bond between them with an enzyme called [[Lipase]].
- once the fat is mobilized you need to burn it by transferring the [[fatty acid]] to the [[mitochondria]], where the [[fatty acid]] can be converted to [[ATP]] and be burned.

### N.E.A.T movement and shivering
- bouncing your knee, pacing, standing up and sitting down are shown to lead to consider amount of weight loss.
- studies have shown that 20-30% extra weight loss due to fidgeting 
- movement from fidgeting promotes the release of [[epinephrine]] which mobilizes stored fat. 
- the act of shivering promotes the release of [[epinephrine]] similarly to N.E.A.T movements
- 3-5x a week take cold showers until shivering then get out for a 3 minutes, then get back in. Repeat 3 times. Do not resist the shivering 
- getting cold adapted will not see results


### Exercise
- high intensity exercise followed by low intensity exercise is the best way to facilitate fat burn, due to the stored fat burned during exercise and the increase in basal metabolic rate after the exercise.
- high intensity exercise releases [[epinephrine]] promoting fat oxidation, common with other forms of fat loss. Release of [[epinephrine]] is the trigger and the affector of fat mobilization.
