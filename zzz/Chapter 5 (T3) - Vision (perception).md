 # [[Chapter 5 (T3) - Vision (perception)]]

### lecture outline / learning goals:
- trace the path of visual information through the anatomy of the visual system
- characterize the hierarchical organization of the visual system
- what is stereo vision?
- Illustrate the results of damage to primary, secondary, and tertiary areas of the visual cortex?
- contrast the ventral and dorsal visual processing streams.
- Summarize why we do not see what is actually "out there", but instead the brain's internal model of the world.

### examples:

### active recall study questions:
- give at least two examples of sensory transduction?
- what does the cornea do?
- what does the iris do?
- what does the pupil do?
- what does the lens do?
- what does the retina do and how is it structured?
	- the retina is made up of 5 major parts:
		- [[retinal ganglion cells]] pass information from the eye to the brain
		- [[amacrine cells]] help retina cells communicate
		- [[bipolar neurons]] carry information from the retinal ganglion cells to the [[photoreceptors]]
		- [[horizontal cells]] communication from adjacent cells in the retina
- what is the process of turning [[photons]] of light into [[neurochemical]] signals?
	- [[photo-transduction]] occurs when a photon of light hits a pigment molecule and breaks it into pieces. The resulting pieces act on the protein molecules within the cell and change the resting potential of the membrane.
	- an enzyme after the reaction put the cell back together
- what are the two types of [[photoreceptors]]? How do they differ?
	- [[rods]], 90 million cells in the eye and are more receptive of light making them responsible for detecting light and darkness
	- [[cones]],  4.5 million cells in the eye and are responsible for detecting light frequencies in brightly lit environments, colour?
		- ***cones*** are more sensitive to fine detail in light frequencies because they are individual connected to a ***[[retinal ganglion cells]]*** and a ***[[bipolar neurons]]*** and the indentation of the [[fovea]] allowing light to better access the [[photoreceptors]]
	- ***cones*** are more concentrated in the center of the [[fovea]], while ***rods*** are more concentrated in the peripheral of the eye
- what is the [[receptive field]] and how does it related the the [[center-surround structure]].
- what is the [[optic nerve]] comprised of which [[axons]]?
	- comprised of [[retinal ganglion cells]]
- where is the [[optic chiasm]]?
	- the left and right halves of the [[primary visual cortex]]
- what kind of information does the [[magnocellular retinal ganglion cells]] carry?
	- get information from rods, depth, brightness, movement
- what kind of information does the [[parvocellular retinal ganglion cells]] carry to the [[LGN (lateral geniculate nucleus)]] ?
	- get information from the cones, colour, detail, 
- what are the V1 neurons responsible for?
	- they are receptive to lines and orientations in visual space.
		- [[complex cells]] respond to preferred orientation of lines, but in any location in the receptive field
		- [[simple cells]] respond to a preferred orientation of lines and in a specific location in the receptive field
- what does it mean for hierarchy? Give an example? 
	- retinal ganglion cells --> LGN cells, then the input for V1 cells are form LGN cells then complex cells are built upon multiple simple cells.
- why do we use stereo vision? How does it help us model the 3D world from two sources of information.
- what is the V2 and V3 / secondary and tertiary visual cortex?
- what is the new processing streams found in the tertiary visual cortex?
- how do inferior temporal lobes process complex information
- how do partial lobes and dorsal streams interact
