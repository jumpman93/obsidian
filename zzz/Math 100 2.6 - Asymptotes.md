 # [[Math 100 2.6 - Asymptotes]]

### lecture outline:
- using limit laws and infinity limit laws to find limits and asymptotes given a function
- 

### examples:

### active recall study questions:
- what happens if given a function with limit x --> (+ and -)$infinity$ to the ***L***(limit) given the function?
- if you have a horizontal asymptote what happens to the limit as x --> $infinity$ in the (- and +)
- if you have a vertical asymptote what happens to the limit as x --> $infinity$ in the (- and +)
- if you have a slant/oblique asymptote what happens to the limit as x --> $infinity$ in the (- and +)
- how do you find the limits of rational functions as the approach infinity?
- when does a function have an oblique asymptote 
- if the limit is written as $infinity$ what does that mean?

***apply concepts***
- computing limits at infinity of rational functions
- computing the vertical asymptote from a limit
- computing the horizontal asymptote from a limit
- computing the oblique asymptote from a limit
