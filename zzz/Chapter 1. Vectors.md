 # [[Chapter 1. Vectors]]

## lecture outline:
### 1.1 Introduction to Vectors
- physics try attempts to take natural phenomenon and put them in mathematical and predictive descriptions
- numerical quantities are called [[scalar]] and quantities that are characterized by a ***single direction*** and a ***amount*** are called [[vectors]].
  - vectors are useful when trying to quantify natural forces with both [[magnitude]] (scalar) and a direction [[unit vector]], forces such as acceleration. 
  - expressing vectors in terms of components and unit vectors is important in some circumstances.

### 1.2 Displacement - a motivating example
- [[displacement (physics)]] is the most basic of vectors, helping describing the addition and scaling of vectors.
  - displacement occurs when a object has moved a distance and a direction, the direction having a reference to a known place of origin
- two objects can have the same displacement given, their distance and direction are the same, irrespective of where the objects started or ended. 

***Addition of Vectors***
- vector addition / displacement can be thought of a series of steps that do not rely on order. 
- having the vectors go tail to tip, allows you to add or subtract vector magnitudes and direction, given one of the vector has a greater opposite direction.
  - as long as the vectors meet the conditions of having a direction and magnitude they can be added together in any order.

- subtraction of vectors follows the same principles as adding vectors together

***Scaling Vectors***
- multiplying a displacement by a real positive number  ***c*** will change the displacement distance by ***c***, while a negative real number ***c*** will change the displacement distance by ***c*** and make that vector in the opposite direction.
- using a ***[[cardinal plane]]*** you can use substitute vectors arbitrary directions with directions on the cardinal plane.

- taking the displaced value of two vectors added or multiplied together, you can use their individual displacement distances and the angle of the original vector too find the total displaced value of the new vector.

### 1.3 Vectors and their properties
- displacement is a good visual aid to what is known as a vector


***Vectors***
- vectors have a length (magnitude) and a single direction
  - the vectors magnitude must have a unit value, such as *$meters$*, etc.
- vectors can be added, the addition is commutative and vectors must have the same units to add them together
- vector multiplication is to multiply the ***magnitude*** by that amount, and multiplying by a real negative number will reverse the direction and scale the ***magnitude*** by that amount.
- you can multiply a vector together with different dimensonal numbers as too create a new vector with different units. 
  - multiplying a velocity vector ($m/s$) by a mass vector ($kg$) will leave you with a vector with unit ($kg*m/s$)

### 1.3.1 Coordinate Systems
- the coordinate system is used to standardize the cardinal directions that vectors can have, having a center called "origin", vectors can have direction typically on directions with intervals of $90 degrees$
- basis vectors ([[unit vector]]) are vectors with magnitude $=1$ that are denoted along the x,y,z axis, being $i$, $j$, $k$ respective to the x,y,z axis. 

### 1.4 Manipulation of Vectors
- vectors are expressed with an $arrow$ and unit vectors are expressed with an $hat$ on top

- addition of vectors can be done by adding their matching components together then finding the new sum of the vector
  - vectors can only be considered equal if they share the exact same components.

- multiplication is by a real number multiplies each component of the vector by the real number $c$; for this example
  - always perform the algebra and set the vector function before substituting the values in.

- the vector magnitude is found by using the [[pythagorean theorem]] and is expressed using the $|A|$ notation

- the angle of the vector is found between the component of the vector along the a axis, (for the example, the vector $A$ is being related to the x axis, denoting $/theta x$)
  - each $Ay$, $Az$ has a corresponding axis where an angle can be found given a component lies on its axis.

### 1.5 Scalar Product

***[[Dot Product (physics)]]***
- multiplying vectors together occurs during a scalar multiplication, where the magnitudes of components are multiplied together between two vectors.
  - when multiplying scalar products you take the ***magnitudes*** between two vectors and the ***$cos$*** of the angle between the two vectors. This version of the dot product is the geometric definition, referring to vectors in euclidean space.
  - the ***algebraic definition*** is just the sum of the components of two vectors
![](https://i.imgur.com/u6gEU03.png)

- by this definition you can find the components of a vector by multiplying it by its appropriate unit vector.

- and a direction multiplication, where unit vectors are multiplied together.
   - unit vector multiplication always results in 1 because a unit vector has a magnitude 1 and only should be multiplied by a unit vector of the same direction
      - $i+i=1, j+j=1, k+k=1$

### 1.6 Vector Product
- the ***[[cross product]]*** is another way two vectors are multiplied but instead of only finding a scalar value, you can find another perpendicular vector, it is denoted with a $x$
  - the magnitude of the new vector is the product of the magnitude between the two vectors and the sine of the angle between them. 
  - the direction of the new vector is perpendicular two the original two vectors but is undefined as there are two directions ***perpendicular***, one being positive and one being negative.
    - you can use the right hand rule to find the direction, your thumb is the the direction of the product vector, while your fingers point toward the direction of vector 1, while your palm points toward vector 2.

- following the right hand rule, unit vectors can be computed as follows:
