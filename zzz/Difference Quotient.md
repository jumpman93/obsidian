## Difference Quotient
- the [[average rate of chance (AROC)]] of a function between two intervals.
- a [[secant]] is straight line in between an interval
- on the interval $(a,f(a)) (b,f(b))$ the secant line is the slope between these two points. 
# $m=\frac{rise}{run}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}==\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$
- to simplify the equation, you substitute the y in the final equation with ***h, h*** being the difference in length between point ***x and y***
 # $=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$

### example

- given a $f(x)$ function sub in $f(x+h)$ to all the x's!
