 # [[Chapter 4 (T3)- Perception]]

### important notes:
- the brain is efficient in optimizing and allocating neural resources.
- some genetic instructions are hardwired, while most are flexible in their approaching, providing the framework for change dependent on the brain's interaction with the environment.

### examples:

### active recall study questions:
- how should we think about the brain function. A rigid system or a constantly evolving and adapting system responding to new situations
- what are the two types of cell death and what is there difference?
	- necrosis and apoptosis
	- cells pruning is due to a refinement of the neural connections and functions.
	- babies are born with 50% more neurons than needed, to further refine the brain.
- what is the process of refining of [[synapes]]?
- what is the difference between top and [[bottom down processing]]?
- what is [[adaptive coding]]?
	- the brain can allocate more or less neural activity to a motor or sensory functions.
		- someone becoming more proficient at the violin will see a increase in finger representation on a cortical map. 
		- in rehab, paralyzed limbs can gain more function through deliberate usage of that limb and restraining the working limb, constraint therapy. Not using the working hand prevents the working hands neural mapping from taking over the weaker hand.
- how are some aspects of our brain hard wired?
	- some neural pathways are hardwired as fibers in the retina will always find their way to the visual thalamus, regardless of external experience.
- how is the brain structured to grow from its external environment?
	- the brain comes with rough circuitry that gets refined and processed when interacting with its environment. 
	- the brain only comes with 25000 protein coding genes, so in order to develop its complexity it allows for a flexible approach to change, suiting its needs.
