 # [[Using table to approximate limit values]]
- tables are useful to understand the functions behavior, as they give us a more accurate estimates of the [[limits (math)]] value.
- tables give us exact values when we approach the [[function value]].

### common mistakes
- don't assume the [[function value]] as the limit value
- not getting close enough to the [[function value]]
- assuming that the approaching from the left means using negative numbers
- not approaching from both the left and right side
