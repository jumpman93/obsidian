### Notes :

***Chapter 2: Attention and Effort***
- [[System 1]] has a fundamental understanding of how the world operates and uses that knowledge to function, when it runs into trouble it calls on [[System 2]] to consciously process challenging information.
- [[System 2]] is responsible for self control
- [[Cognitive Illusions]] are initially impressions of things that [[System 1]] undertakes, that are not necessarily true. Due to the fact that [[System 1]] works 24/7 and can not be turned off, in order to avoid [[Cognitive Illusions]] we must use [[System 2]] to process information to come to a belief which we can reference in the future when faced with the same [[Cognitive Illusions]]. Having a hierarchy of importance is necessary as we can't consciously process everything.
- a cognitive baseline is in play until a task is required that proceeds the threshold. Pupil dilation can be used as a measure of cognitive difficultly. 
- cognitive operation tasks tend to max out the limits of [[System 2]]'s operational capacity, while compared to storing or recalling digits. (pg.36)
- [[Executive Control]] is the process of overriding innate behavior to perform a goal-directed behavior in conscious thought.
- psychologists have recently noted the difficultly of switching between two tasks while retaining a high level of attention and focus.
- time also plays a role in our cognitive ability to perform tasks
- [[Cognitive Load]] is a set cognitive effort required to perform various cognitive tasks, (eg; remembering a set of 7 digits). [[System 2]] can not exceed the effort required to do such a task.

***Chapter 3: The Lazy Controller***
- [[Ego Depletion]] is the decrease in self control when forced to do a task that require, cognitive, physical or social effort. In experiments done by [[Roy Baumesiter]] in which participants had to exert effort into a task that required self control. If asked to do another task, their ability to complete that task would become diminished. A hypothetical [[pool of effort]] that cognitive, physical and social tasks all draw effort from, will diminish sequential  difficult tasks.
- The difference between [[Ego Depletion]] and [[Cognitive Load]] is that more effort can be extended while doing a task that involves [[Ego Depletion]] while a threshold cannot be breached when undergoing a tasks that evolves [[Cognitive Load]]. (pg. 43)
- [[Ego Depletion]] is analogous to running as mental activity requiring self-control consumes [[glucose]] and a depleted level of ego can be replenished by consuming glucose just as running consumes glucose. (pg. 43)
- the hypothesis that glucose can replenish [[Ego Depletion]] can be seen by a study conducted in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Science]] where Israel judges that were reviewing parole were more likely to grant parole after eating a meal, and more likely to fall back to their default position of (denying parole) after extended periods of not eating. The authors showed a spike of 65% approval of parole after finishing a meal and a slow decline of approval, approaching zero following the meal. The authors conclude that it is a result of fatigue and hunger
