## Summary of key points:
### [[Deep work]]
- [[Deep work]] is focused uninterrupted work the pushes your cognitive abilities to their limit. Important work should be done in this state, as valuable insights and progress come from [[Deep work]]
- [[Deep work]] is important to acquiring new skills and implementing them into output, elevating your status in the **economy of knowledge**
- humans can cap out at 4 hours of deep work a day.

***[[Shallow Work]]*** is work aimed for tasks that dosen't require deep concentration, eg; checking emails, filling forms etc.

***deep work should be isolated for the most wildly important goals***  
- any tasks that meaningfully improves your life should be done in deep work.

***deep work is equivalent training a muscle***
- consciously being aware when you feel the urge to reach for a distraction is training the muscle to do deep work longer.

### Deep work is Fulfilling
- [[Shallow Work]] is deceptive as it illudes relatively meaningless tasks into a sense of productivity. While deep work can feel directionless, as complex problems require long period of focused thought.

***Deep work is the state in which people feel the most fulfilled***
- [[Mizani Chifdksalti]]'s research on flow shows that greatest satisfaction comes from cognitive challenges and not leisure time.

***Deep work protects our focus from psychological irritants***
- [[The meaning of happiness: attention and time perception]] studies show that that there is a direct correlation with attentiveness and happiness. [[Deep work]] allows constrained focus and the meaningful things in our life, limiting negative distractions from our life.

## Rule #1 Practice Deep Work
- building the habit of deep work, takes consistency and setting time aside in advance to focus on deep work.
- Deep work can be practiced in four types of deep work schedules

***Monastic Schedule***
- remove as many [[Shallow Work]] task from your life. Outsource necessary [[Shallow Work]]
- removing your self from digital instant communication, being off the grid and for extend periods of time to solely devote yourself to the overarching goal
- Example: Bill Gates goes to a cabin in the woods with prepared meals to work think about Microsoft.

***Bimodal/Periodic Schedule***
- scheduling periods of times weekly, monthly or quarterly to deep work. The minimum should be one day completely dedicated to deep work, a few hours in the morning is not enough.
- Examples: professors often take semester-long sabbaticals to focus on deep research. Bill Gates takes "think weeks" twice a year.

***Rhythmic Schedule***
- structuring recurring times daily to do deep work. eg; 6:30am to 10:30am every morning for deep work.
- cons: extend periods of time (beyond daily) isn't adequate for this schedule.


### Environment
***Choose where to do deep work***
- choose a single place where you will exclusively do [[Deep work]]
- [[Shallow Work]] should be done in other areas
- [[Condo Planning]] ***hubs*** and ***spoke*** are terms used in floor planning offices of new places, where ***hubs*** should be places of communal work while ***spoke*** should be places of [[Deep work]] 

***Distraction-free environment***
- through your phone in the trash and put it on mute, it the internet is necessary turn on website blockers  
- remove appealing distractions


***Prime your deep work***
- your ritual to start deep work should include things that will provide relief to possible distractions; hunger, thirst, light exercise.

### The 4 Disciplines of execution
- principles to help execute [[Deep work]]

***Focus on the wildly important***
- provide a rational to why the work you choose is important
- the goals should be small and complex, instead of many trivial goals

***Use leading metrics***
-  use immediately measurable metrics that show you how you can improve. Eg; numbers of hours spent in deep work, lines of code, pages written, pages read and new ideas generated.

***Keep a scoreboard***
- keep the leading metrics visible to motivate you to striving for more
- physical artifacts that show the metrics are better

***Stay accountable***
- consciously think about the time spent in deep work, was it productive, how can you improve.
- create weekly reviews on the productivity of your deep work, what went wrong and how you can improve.

### Shutdown ritual
- shutting down after a certain time in the day is important as 24/7 of productive work isn't productive.
- we start the day with a limited amount of willpower and at a certain time it is counter productive to keep working. 

***the unconscious though theory***
- this theory is based upon [[System 1]]: subconscious thought is always active in the brain, and constantly working to solve problems. Not providing breaks for your subconscious will slow down the effectiveness of your subconscious problem solving. 

***Shutdown ritual***
- you want to be confident in your day, not anxiously thinking about the tasks you might have missed or have to do before you sleep.


1. check for any last urgent items
3. write down a todo list of unresolved items for the next day
4. schedule the to do list with [[Time Blocking]]
5. review calendar to prime information on deadlines and events
6. shlep

## Rule 2: Improve Your Ability to Focus
- increasing the capacity to which you can focus and the time to get to focus

***Habitually indulging in your distractions reduces your ability to focus***
- neurologically, constantly switching your attention will decrease your ability to get into deep focus and are more prone to being distracted
- being able to remove boredom by distractions is counter productive to increasing your ability of focus. 

***focus should be your default state, distraction is breaking that state***
- instead of setting periods of focus, set blocks of time where you allow yourself to be distracted.

### Techniques to increase focus
***Avoid the internet when scheduling times of focus***
- switching from high-stimuli to low-stimuli tasks frequently will reduce you ability to focus and tolerate boredom.
- resists temptation for your break time, as to train the focus muscle and tolerate boredom
- schedule times where you allow yourself to use the internet
- plan you work to remove all need to use the internet, if your work needs to use to internet move onto the next task, as you didn't plan well enough.

***Be ruthless in allocating time to deep work***
- if you estimate how long a task will take you, cut down the time to provide a sense of urgency.

***Practice mindful meditation***
- when during low physical activity, think about the problem
- increases ability to focus and typically away from distractions

***Prime the problem in your head***
- during your ritual to start deep work, thinking about the variables the will go into completing the task

***Practice memorization techniques***
- the better you are at memorizing the larger the capacity of information you can hold while in deep work.

## Rule #3: Contain Your Distractions
### Justify your internet usage
- the justification of mindlessly watching Youtube is the possible gain of information. But this decreases your ability to focus as you constantly switch from stimuli to stimuli.

***Make well-reasoned arguments to why you should use the internet***
- make a list of the most important goals for you personal and professionally
    - list 2 - 3 most influential tasks that will help you achieve these 
    - they should be reoccurring specific tasks that can be performed regularly. 
       - eg; reguarly read the cutting edge papers in my field
 - tally up the time you spend on distraction, propose alternative activates you could be doing to further achieve your goals.

### Tactics for better internet usage
1. take an experiment and quit a certain internet application for 30 days and see if your life was better without it.
2. instead of using the internet, plan out physical hobbies as another way to spend time

## Rule #4: Cut out Shallow Work
- eliminating [[Shallow Work]] will allow you to spend more time in deep work

### Constrain Your Worktime each day and week
- have a point of time where you stop working and can begin the shutdown period and relax with hobbies
- ask yourself how much could you get done in 4hours of focused work, if that was all the time you had.

***the 80-20rule***
- you get 80% of the work done in 20% of the time, the diminishing return on time working after a certain point is not worth the mental strain that inhibits your ability for deep work.

### [[Plan out every minute of your day, and quantify depth]]
***planning the time in advanced will reduce the friction of switching tasks*
1. time block in chunks of 30minutes
2. schedule over run time for blocks so you have a buffer to run over
3. schedule time in advance for when you'll use the internet, avoid completely outside these times

***estimate the amount of time and depth of work***
- estimate the time it will take you to complete the task and quantify the complexity of the task.
- the more complex the task the more focus required.

***minimize the shallow work***
- a 30-50% (shallow-deep) is recommended for beginners
- maximize the efficiency of your time, by reducing the shallow work.



### Strategies

***Have a single target focus***
- having a single point of focus will create more effective work

***Keep the session sacred***
- regardless of the minutia of the distraction do not do it, stay solely focused on the work. 
- deep worked is anchored focus that once taken off course will hamper your ability to stay in deep work

***Make deep work a habit***
- setup reoccurring blocks of time to do deep work, either single days of the week or a time period (6:30am - 10:30am)

***Diagnose your current practices***
- outline your major life goals, and 2-3 key activates that will drive you towards them
- list the amount of time spent on things, do they help achieve my major goals
- experiment with completely shutting down activities that don't benefit my major life goals

***Create an environment of deep work***
- choose a working space dedicated to deep work
- reduce distractions (turn off phone, hunger, thirst, novel information), isolate yourself so that nothing can distract you.

***Create a beginning of day ritual***
- have a sequence of things that you do at the beginning of every day, to  habitualize getting into deep work
- time block the day into chunks
    - make the deadlines challenging, where only deep work can achieve the task.
- quantify the complexity of the task
    - how long would a intelligent graduate with no experience take to do this task

- schedule times of distraction, use this time purely for breaks
    - cap the end of the day at 6pm, as no more productive work can be done, use this time to relax and reset for the next day
    - use this time to wrap up the ***to do list** of the day and create the [[Time Blocking]] schedule for the next day.
