 # [[Neuron]]

### TLDR;
- a structured cells that have a structure and are responsible for information processing

### The Neuron Doctrine

1. The neuron is an anatomical unit --> has a defined structure
2. THe neuron is a metabolic unit --> trophic
3. THe neuron is an embryological unit --> a neuron non static and is develops within a developmental trend throughout the human life
4. The Law of dynamic polarization --> a specific neuron has a specific task, a motor neuron is different from sensor neuron
5. The neuron is a basic information processing unit --> a neuron endocdes and transmisses informaiton to other structure in the mind and body.

### The Anatomy of a Neuron

- ***a neuron has 4 structual divisions***
- [[soma]] --> the cell body
- [[dendrites]] --> 
- [[axon]] --> the path way between dendrites and terminal boutons
- [[terminal boutons]]

***a neuron structure determines the processing of information in the neuron***
1. [[dendrites]] --> inputs information from other neurons
2. [[nucleus]] --> where the information is processes
3. [[axon hillock]] --> where the information is compiles
4. [[axon]] --> that transmits the information, fatty substance called [[milen]] helps speed of information processing
5. [[terminal boutons]] --> (***NOT SYNAPES***) where neuron transmitters connect to another neuron the start the process again

***anatomy in information processing***

- [[afferent]] --> sensory/outer body information that comes in
  - afferent cells take information to process them
  
- [[efferent]] --> information processed and acted on
  - efferent cells uses information to act on

- [[sensory]] --> behaviour that comes from our sensory organs
- [[motor]] --> motor movement from muscle contraction etc. 

***neuron activation without sensory information***
- [[mirror neurons]]
- thinking and imagining -->
