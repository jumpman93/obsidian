### TLDR:
- tasks that require self control work on a hypothetical [[pool of effort]] that deplenishes over time, making every consecutive task requiring [[System 2]] to be more difficult.

### Notes:
- the study conducted by the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Science]] shows a link between glucose levels and ability to self control. Analogous to a runner who uses energy from glucose levels, [[Ego Depletion]] has a hypothetical link towards glucose

### Relation of other concepts:
- [[Ego Depletion]] and [[Cognitive Load]] differ due the ability of the person too dictate the amount of effort given the task. A [[Cognitive Load]] task would be something related to [[cognitive operational]] tasks (remembering a 7 digit string). This task would have a effort threshold that would couldn't be breached through purely effort, unlike a task linked with [[Ego Depletion]].

### Relevant studies:
- [[Roy Baumesiter]] conducted studies where participants had to perform tasks that required self control and the use of [[System 2]]. Sequential tasks after would result in a decrease in performance and willingness to the tasks. The authors made the analogy towards a [[pool of effort]], where any task that requires physical, cognitive or social effort took from the pool and sequential drained from the pool with most use from it. 
- [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Science]] had a study involving Israel judges who spend entire days processing parole requests in random order. Initially the judges would permit paroles at a rate of 65%, but after prolong periods that rate would drop close to zero. Once the judges were given a break and eat food, the acceptance rate would go back to 65%, the proceed to drop until the judges were given another food break.
