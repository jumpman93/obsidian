 # [[Composite functions]]
- if a the limit of a function exists, $f(lim)$ will equal $f(x)=\#$ if the line is continuous

### composite functions of internal limits
- the limit of $g(x)$ can still exist even if the $h(x)$ limit does note exist.
- solve for the limit for the right and left hand side and apply that value to the main function, if equal $g(h(x))=\#$

### composite functions of external limits
- if a limit exists but the function limit does not exist, you solve the function limit by finding the limits of the left and right sided limit.
- the left and right sided limit is determined by where the initial limit came from $- or +$
