 # [[Chapter 2 (T2)- Brains]]

## lecture outline:

### The Nervous System
- structure and function are linked, as one effects the other, the other is also effected
  - large differences between function and structure throughout species, can relate back to environmental challenges
  - structure and function arn't always linked

***[[radical networks]]***
- invertebrates, functionality is rhythmic
  - complex actions and functions are limited to rhythmic consistent functions 

***[[bilateral netowrks]]***
- ***ganglia clusters***
	- often reflex/automatic

- ***brain*** (centralized systems)

-------


### Terminology
***body***
- ***[[Dorsal (brain structure)]]*** = back
- ***[[Ventral]]*** = belly
- ***[[rostral]]*** = noise
- ***[[caudal]]*** = tail

***with regards to space***
- ***superior*** = above
- ***inferior*** = below
- ***anterior*** = in-front
- ***posterior*** = behind



***planes***
- ***sagittal*** = side to side, Left to Right
- ***axial*** = horizontal, on x-axis
- ***coronal*** = back -> front, top down

---
### what to do next:
---
### active recall questions:
***Terminology***
- what plane is the R --> L
- what plane is the Bottom --> top
- what plan is the back --> front
- what is considered same side (brain terminology)
- what is considered opposite side?
- what is considered both sides?
- what is considered the ***periphery*** term for near
- what is considered the periphery term for far
- what is considered the term for center
- what is considered the term fore side

***Peripheral Nervous System***
- what system in the [[Peripheral Nervous System]] (PNS) is voluntary
- what system in the (PNS) is involuntary
- how does the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system differ and relate.
- what system is voluntary and responsible for fast actions
- what system is involuntary and responsible for bodily functions
- where is the cervical spine and what is it responsible for?
- where is the thoracic spine and what is it responsible for?
- where is the lumbar spine and what is it responsible for?
- what is order of the cranial nerves?
- what is the order and function of the sensory?
- what is the order and function of the motor?
- what is the order and function of the sensory/motor?

***chapter 2***
- what is a [[bilateral animal]]? What are the two main features of a bilateral animal?
- how did brains initially developed in animals?
- why do [[vertebrates]] control opposites sides of their body with the opposite side of the brain?
- what does the [[central nervous system]] control?
- what are the initial three zones/buldges of a vertebrates brain?
- what does the [[forebrain]] subdivided into after 4 weeks (embryo)? 
- what does the [[hindbrain]] subdivided into after 4 weeks (embryo)?
- label the anatomical direction of the brain.
- what is the relationship of [[motor neuron]] to muscles?
- what are the four neuron types in the [[peripheral nervous system]]?
- what are the two main components of the peripheral nervous system? What are their functions and how do they differ?
- what is the subdivisons of the [[autonomic nervous system]]?
- what are the functions of the [[parasympathetic]] and the [[sympathetic nervous system]]?
- what are the skin stripes responsible for sensory information called? what are the muscle stripes called?
- what parasympathetic and sympathetic functions are connected to different regions in the spine?
- what is the process of input --> output in a spinal segment?
- what does the cross section of the spine look like?
- what is the difference between white and [[grey matter]]?
- what are the two types of [[sensory neurons]] in the grey matter, and which ones control the input and output?
- what is a [[reflex arc]] in terms of [[neuron circuits]]?
- what is the difference between a [[monosynaptic]] and [[polysynaptic circuit]]?
- what is a [[interneuron]] and how does it relate to inhibitory signals between other neurons?
- explain what [[central pattern generator]]s are and what their circuitry is?
