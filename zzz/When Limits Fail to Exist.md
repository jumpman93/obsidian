[[Calculus 1]]
# Limits Fail to Exist when
### Limits from the left and right arn't equal
- as limits approach a value that is undefined and do not equal from left or right side

### Vertical Asymptotes
- as limits approach a value they will trend towards $\infty$ and $-\infty$

### Wild Limits
- if limit is $\sin$ the values will oscillating between two values on the y axis, touching every single [[Real Number]] within the interval
### $lim \ x->0\ sin(\frac{\pi}{x})$
