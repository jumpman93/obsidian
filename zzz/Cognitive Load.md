`relevant links`[[Ego Depletion]] [[Cognitive Load]] [[Thinking Fast and Slow]]

### TLDR:
- the set amount of working memory when processing information (eg; when remembering a 7 digit string)


### Relation of other concepts:
 - [[Ego Depletion]] and [[Cognitive Load]] differ due the ability of the person too dictate the amount of effort given the task. A [[Cognitive Load]] task would be something related to [[cognitive operational]] tasks (remembering a 7 digit string). This task would have a effort threshold that would couldn't be breached through purely effort, unlike a task linked with [[Ego Depletion]].
