### purpose
- to study the blindness humans face when highly focused on a task

### method
- the participants were instructed to count the amount of balls that were passed between players only wearing a certain color jersey.
- once the participants were sufficiently focused a black gorilla suit walked right passed the players, but since the participants were so focused a majority of them complete missed the gorilla.

>The gorilla study illustrates two important facts about our mind: we can be blind to the obvious and we are blind to our blindness
