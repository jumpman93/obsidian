 # [[Chapter 5. Kinematics]]

### lecture outline / learning goals:
1. [[Kinematics]] is the physics of moving objects, previously we looked at [[Chapter 3. Rotational Equilibrium]] and [[Chapter 2. Translation Equilibrium]] which are static vectors.
2. [[trajectory (physics)]] is the vector an object takes in relation to space and time from a final and origin position vector
3. [[intergral]] is the anti-[[derivative]], eg; taking the integral of acceleration you can find the velocity of a function
