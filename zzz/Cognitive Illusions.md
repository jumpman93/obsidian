### TLDR;
- [[Cognitive Illusions]] are initially impressions of things that [[System 1]] undertakes, that are not necessarily true. Due to the fact that [[System 1]] works 24/7 and can not be turned off, in order to avoid [[Cognitive Illusions]] we must use [[System 2]] to process information to come to a belief which we can reference in the future when faced with the same [[Cognitive Illusions]]. Having a hierarchy of importance is necessary as we can't consciously process everything.
