 # [[PHYS 110 - Lecture 2 Vectors]]

## lecture outline:

### Scalar Math
- non linear algebra (somtimes) that allows one to add, subtract and [[scalar multiplication]] [[vectors]].  

### Vector Notation

- generally a vector is notated by a arrow, line, etc over a placeholder term (e.g; $a$), also comes in bolded form
- vectors come in different forms such as [[vertical form (vectors)]] and come with a subscript notating their direction on a 3D plane (e.g; $x, y, z$)
- a vector is made up of $(components)(unit vectors)$ = $Axi$, with $i$ having a unit vector hat

- the [[unit vector]] notates the direction while the components convey how much.
- 

### Absolute Values
- [[absolute values]] are the distance away that number is from zero.
  - E.g; $|3| = 3$ and $|-3| = 3$, since both $3,-3$ are 3 units away from zero, both have numbers have the absoulte value of 3
