 # [[ECON 104 - Chapter 9 Long-Run Economic Growth]]

### lecture outline:
- why is long run economic growth measured in the increase in real GDP per capita?
	- How has real GDP per capita changed over time in different countries?
		- Calculation methods for determining growth rates?
- Why is productivity the key to long-run economic growth? How is productivity driven by [[physical capital]], [[human capital]], and [[technological progress]]
- Why do long-run growth rates differ so much among countries?
- How does growth vary in important regions of the world?
	- Why does the [[convergence hypothesis]] apply to economically advanced countries
- How does scarcity of natural resources and environmental degradation pose a challenge to sustainable long urn economic growth

### examples:
***General rules for calculating percentage changes in economic figures***

***per worker production function***

- using historical data physical capital saw diminishing returns as it increases, suggesting that human capital and the state of technology are held fixed.
	- as an example, a worker with a 40k tractor will not produce double a worker with a 20k tractor.

	- in general it takes increase in all of the major functions of aggregate and per worker function to result in higher gdp per capita.



### active recall study questions:
- what is the rule of 70?
	- the ***# of years for X to double = 7/annual % growth rate of X***
		- the rough estimate is emphasises the fact that small changes over a long period of time can have large effects.
- what are the major sources of long run growth?
	- [[labour productivity]], increase in [[physical capital]], increase in [[human capital]] and technological progress.
- why does productivity increase long run growth / per capita GDP?
	- a countries population growth and employment growth is similar over the long term, and sharp increases in employment are not sustainable.  
- explain the what increases of physical capital look like
	- increases in quality and amount of physical capital per worker results in more productivity per worker. 
- explain what increases in human capital look like
	- increased quality of education and training results in more productive human capital.
- explain the importance of technological progress
	- increases in technological innovation can range from the railroad, to processed foods to precut cardboard. These all result in greater productivity as a whole in an economy?
- what is the ***[[aggregate production function]]***
	- the long run increase in living standards results from growing labour productivity
	- Y = A * F(K,L,H)
		- Y = aggregate real output (GDP)
		- K = amount of physical capital used
		- L = amount of labour used
		- H = amount of human capital used
		- A = total factor productivity
		- F(...) the aggregate production function 
		- 
- why is there diminishing returns to an increase in only physical capital.
- what is growth accounting
	- it measures the impact of one of the major functions of the per worker production function
- what is the ***[[productivity paradox]]***
	- some recent technological advances haven't seen the grand increase in total factor productivity 
- how does saving and investment spending affect the long run growth of a country
	- increases in [[investment spending with]] [[domestic savings]] or [[foreign savings]] allows a country to increase growth rates if done properly.
- how does increase to level of education affect the long run growth of a country
	- increasing the productivity of human capital through education helps increase the overall productivity of a country, therefore increasing the growth rate over time.
- how does RND and technological innovation effect a countries growth rate.
- what is the role of the government in promoting economic growth
	- government subsidies to ***infrastructure***
	- government subsidies to ***education***
	- government subsidies to ***R&D***
	- maintaining a well functioning ***financial system***
	- protection of ***Property rights***
		- protection of intellectual property rights motivates people to innovate knowing their innovation legally protected.
	- political stability and good governance
