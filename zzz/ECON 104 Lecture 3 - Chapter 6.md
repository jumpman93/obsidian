 # [[ECON 104 Lecture 3 - Chapter 6]]

## lecture/chapter outline (study questions):
- the difference between macroeconomics and microeconomics?
- what are business cycles?
  - why do policy makers try to diminish their severity?
- how does long-run economic growth determine a country's standard of living?
- what are inflation and deflation?
   - why is price stability preferred by economists?
- why are open-economies important?
  - how do they interact with trade deficits and trade surpluses?
  -  describe how the [[Business cycle]] was affected by covid-19.
- how do economic institutions measure short run recessions and expansions?
-
## important take away:
- skin over the ***The Economics of Biodiversity: The Dasgupta Review*** (executive summary)

### The Paradox of thrift
- when expecting an economic down-turn families and small business will stop spending and start saving, 
  - this is a considered and economic paradox because the limiting of spending will make the individuals worse off, if they were too continue spending
  - negative news regarding possible economic down-turns can become self fulfilling, as people cut back on spending, which if done in a large enough scale can cause a economic down-turn

### general pre-1930's economic wisdom:
- ***[[Self-regulating economy]]*** economic problems such as unemployment will be resolved without government intervention [[laissez faire]] economists also claim that economy's in a down-turn will natural come back to normality without government intervention.  
- ***[[the invisible hand]]*** refers too individual purists in economic growth will accumulate to promote overall economic growth in an economy.

### general post-1930's economic wisdom:
- ***[[Keynesian economics]]*** down-turns in economies are due to lack of spending (individuals) proportional to the production of the economy as a whole, this can be fixed through government policies influencing general spending in an economy. 
- ***[[Monetary Policy]]*** changes in money supply to alter interest rates and overall spending
- ***[[Fiscal Policy]]*** changes in government spending and taxes in influence greater economic activity. 

### The Great and Recession and Depression
- in the 1930s economists in favor of pre-1930 economic models argued that the economies will bounce back in the long run, but ***[[John Maynard Keynes]]*** (1923) disagreed saying "in the long run we are all dead.".
   - he argued his position by saying that economists ignore the present problems to look into the future where times are less turbulent 
- the field of ***macroeconomics*** was born out of the great depression, and come the ***Great Recession*** (2008/09) monetary and fiscal policy were used to mitigate the damage, compared to the ***Great Depression***.
- research into the ***COVID-19 Recession*** has shown the bounce back to economic activity will be much sooner due to government intervention and lockdown policies.


### The Business Cycle
***[[Recessions]]*** - periods of economic downturn where output and employment are falling.

- Canada states that two quarters of negative GDP growth can constitute a recession.
  - the ***C.D. Howe Institute's Business Cycle Council*** also includes the 
  magnitude of the downturn along with duration
- recessions increase unemployment, and individuals can suffer from job security and food; food stamp
  - lower economic output and profits
  
  
***[[Expansions]]*** - period of economic growth where output and 
employment are rising
- economic booms that involve great excesses ***(e.g. housing bubble)*** are unsustainable leading to more damaging recessions, i.e the pullback from the economic growth is greater


***[[Business cycle]]*** - the short-run alternative between recessions and expansions.
- the ***peak*** of the business cycle indicated the change from expansion to recession
- the ***trough*** of the business cycle indicates the change from recession to expansion
- policy makers try to limit the volatility of the business cycle by reducing the size of both economic booms and recessions, although success is limited.

### Long-run Economic Growth
- a somewhat recent phenomenon (1650 U.K was relatively the same as two centuries prior) where economic growth has been sustained over a long period of time.  
- economies grow a different rates, (e.g. Canada was substantial poorer that U.K in till the 1950's when Canada saw great economic growth, in a relative short period of time)

### Inflation and Deflation
***[[inflation]]*** - the overall rise of prices
- the short-run movement of inflation are correlated to the changes in business cycle
  - when the economy is in a down-turn, inflation decrease, when an economy seeing economic growth, inflation increases
- the long run changes to inflation are determined by changes in overall supply of money
- reduces the purchasing power of money, so individuals will spend more, devaluing currency and if severe enough hamper the market of trade through hording goods.


***[[deflation]]*** - the overall decrease of prices
- people general hold onto money as prices fall in fear of less cash gain
  - this causes a overall decrease in spending in an economy, resulting in less economic growth
***[[price stability]]*** - when economy prices have *stabilizes*, prices has not changed much 

### International Imbalances
***[[open-economies]]*** - economies that trade goods and service with one another

***[[trade deficit]]*** - when overall imports are greater than exports 
- high investment increases relative to low savings runs a trade deficit
  - this can be further summed as the overall production of a country being less than what it spends on goods and services, negatively impacting domestic workers

***[[trade surplus]]*** - when overall export are greater than imports
- low investment relative to high savings creates a trade surplus
  - this can be further summed as the overall production of a country being more than what it spends on goods and services, positively impacting domestic workers
