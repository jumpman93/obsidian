## main points:

### measuring an economy
- comparing ***[[prodcution]]*** of an economy is an important metric in estimating the value of a specific economy
  - more specifically using ***[[GDP (gross domestic product)]]*** to measure the value of production in an economy.

***[[The National Accounts]]***
- known as the ***National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA)***
  - measure the economic performance of a nations economy and economies condition throughout the business cycle

***finding GDP by national expenditure***
- ***[[Consumer Spending]]***
  - the spending a typical household or individual
- ***[[Government purchases of goods and services]]***
  - the total spending of goods and services by government on federal, provincial and local
- ***[[Investment spending]]***
  - the spending on productive physical capital, imports and exports

- firms sell goods and services and buy resources to produce goods and services from the factor of production markets

- Disposable Income = Factor Income - taxes + transfers
- the green arrows are for funds spent on purchases, and the blue arrow is for funds spent on factor markets and financial markets

### GDP (gross domestic product)
***[[GDP (gross domestic product)]]*** 
- is the measure of total domestic production annually 
- spending is another person's income in the aggregate, so 
$Expenditure = income$

***3 main approaches to calculating GDP***
1. ***[[The Value-Added Approach]]***
- the total value of all goods and services produced
  - ***the value of total sales - the value of intermediate goods
  - [[intermediate goods]] the good and service bought to produce goods and services, the input
2. ***[[The Expenditure Approach]]***
- the total spending on domestically produced goods and services
  - $GDP=C+I+G+X-IM$
  - C = consumer spending, I = investment spending, G = government purchases of goods and services, x = exports sales to foreigners and IM = import purchases of foreign goods
3. ***[[The Income Approach]]***
- the total factor income earned by households and firms in an economy

***[[Gross national product (GNP)]]***
- the total value of goods and services produced by the residents of a nation that own their own means of production
  - the factor income earned by resident of a nation
- differs by ***GDP*** not including factor income from foreign domestic workers and residence income received abroad

***GDP vs GNP***
- typically the difference between the two are small, expect in economic hubs with large amounts of foreign companies and workers; e.g Ireland is a hub for foreign companies and GDP is much larger than GNP
- data is harder to collect for factor income
- GDP is a better look at the total economic activity in a nation


### Critique on GDP
![](https://i.imgur.com/MQIz23i.png)
***main arguments***
- he critiques the way capitalism prioritizes economic progress over human ambition
- the value of happiness, nature, art etc, are not accounted for in calculating GDP, but nuclear warheads are.
- overall negative societal practices are counted in a GDP calculation, such as violent marketing, weapons, locks for prison cells.

### Real GDP
***[[Real GDP]]***
- the total value of goods and service in an economy based on prices during a select base year

***[[Nominal GDP]]***
- the total value of goods and services in an economy based on current prices of the year being calculated for 

### Price index and aggregate price level
***[[Aggregate price level]]***
- the measure of the overall level of prices in the economy
  - calculating the aggregate price level is found by calculating the cost of purchasing a ***market basket***
    - a hypothetical set of goods purchased by a consumer
 
***[[Price Index]]***
 - the cost of purchasing a market basket, while the prices are related to the cost of the market basket in base year and the current year
   - cost of market basket in a given year / cost of market basket in a base year * 1000


***[[Consumer Price Index (CPI)]]***
- the market basket price of a typical household
