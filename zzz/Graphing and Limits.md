# Graphs and Limits

## [[limits (math)]]
- a graph with ***x and y*** functions that approach a undefined value on the left and right are considered [[limits (math)]]
- 
### 
### $lim \ x->a \ f(x) = L$

## one sided limits
- limits that approach a value from the left(negative) or right(positive) side on a graph
### $lim \ x->a^+ \ f(x) = L$
### $lim \ x->a^- \ f(x) = L$

## infinite limits
- limits that approach a value horizontally towards $+\infty$ or $-\infty$
### $lim \ x->a \ f(x) = \infty$
### $lim \ x->a \ f(x) = -\infty$
