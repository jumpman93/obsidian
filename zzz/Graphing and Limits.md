# Graphs and Limits

## [[limits (math)]]
- a graph with functions that approach a undefined or defined value on the left and right are considered [[limits (math)]]
- [[limits (math)]] is the value as it approaches the [[function value]]
- there does not need to be a [[function value]] in order for there to be a [[limits (math)]]

- ***the limit is 4.2 and the function value is 1.7***

### $lim \ x->a \ f(x) = L$

## one sided limits
- limits that approach a value from the left(negative) or right(positive) side on a graph
- if both limits do not approach the same value then the limits are considered to not exist.
### $lim \ x->a^+ \ f(x) = L$
### $lim \ x->a^- \ f(x) = L$

## infinite limits
- limits that approach a value horizontally towards $+\infty$ or $-\infty$
### $lim \ x->a \ f(x) = \infty$
### $lim \ x->a \ f(x) = -\infty$
