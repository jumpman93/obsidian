 # [[Chapter 3 (T1) - Neurons]]

## Sections:
### Cells of the Brain
***[[Neuron]]***
- although they perform the standard functions of a normal cell, they have a particular protein on their shell, that allows them to send electrical signals to other neurons at extremely fast rates, over long periods of time.

-the neuron consists of ***four*** main sections:
- ***[[dendrites]]*** (collecting)
  - they branch out taking many different forms, ranging from pancake shapes to large complex network.
  - ***dendrites*** specialize in collecting information from small chemical signals, the use of their network of branches allows them to capture these chemical signals and pass them down to the ***[[soma]]***


- ***[[soma]]*** (integrating)
  - also referred to as the cell body, the ***soma*** is responsible for gathering and categorizing the information passed from the dendrites.
  - a key feature of the ***soma*** is the cells nucleus which regulates cell activity and gene expression
    
- ***[[axon]]*** (transferring)
  - connecting the ***soma*** to the rest of the neuron, the ***axon*** acts as a large cable used for transmitting information from the head of the neuron to the tail.
  - the ***axon*** defers from the dendrites by having only a single axon, compared to the multiple dendrites
     - being much larger then the dendrites
     - being consistent diameter 
  - the axons will split into approximately 10000n ***[[axon terminals]]***, sometimes called ***boutons***.
- ***[[axon terminals]]***(distributing)
   - ***axon terminals*** most notable trait is that they bulge at their tips, which send chemical packages to other neurons.
   - ***axon terminals*** are often found close to the ***dendrites*** and ***soma*** of other neurons, these junctions are called ***[[synapes]]***
- ***[[synapes]]*** 
  - the location of transmission, the ***synapse*** sends information from the axon terminals to the dendrites of different neuron.
  - although mainly occurring at the axon terminal, some synapses can occur at the axon, they are known as ***passant synapses***
  - similar to a passant synapses, synapses can join an axon to a dendrite, soma and some can join dendrite to dendrite, axon to axon, although rare.
  - the number of synapses in the brain is in the 100's-1000s of trillions and decreases over age, due to a natural pruning

### Many Different Types of Neurons
- neurons come in a wide range of diversity, but the most common way to classify neurons is by their function

***sensory neurons***
- they directly responded to sensory information

***motor neurons***
- directly connected to muscles as general movement, the final step to change your body or environment. 

- neurons can be further broken down into ***[[afferent]]*** and ***[[efferent]]*** neurons, being the incoming and outgoing neurons respectively. 
- the range in neurons is wide, and neurons are often categorized into on a spectrum

***neuron structure***
- neurons can be broken down further into their respective structure

***[[multipolar neurons]]***
- neurons with multiple ***dendrites***, being the most common


***[[bipolar neurons]]***
- are composed of a single dendrite and axon on their respective ends
  - found in the retina or inner ear

***[[monopolar neurons]]***
- a single extension neuron with typically only a ***soma***, generally are sensory neurons responsible for pain receptors

***[[Glial Cells]]***
- although not fully understood, they are known to help the speed at which information is processed, regulating chemical concentrations and determining the extent neurons can modify their networks
- they come in 4 main types


- ***[[oligodendrocytes]]***
  - they wrap fatty structures around axons, known as myelination, helps speed up the transmission of information
  - they wrap up to 50 neurons and are only found in the central nervous system


- ***[[Schwann Cells]]***
  - similar to ***oligodendrocytes***, they wrap myelin sheaths around a single axon
    - ***mylein sheaths*** are not a continuous fatty sheet around the axon but rather, segmented clumps of fat, with the breaks being called ***nodes of Ranvier***

- ***[[astrocyte]]***
  - acting as a repair neuron, it is named for its star shape but is responsible for 
    - balancing chemical outside the neuron
    - the repair of injury in the central nervous system
    - contribution of neurons
    - regulation of blood flow to a region 
    - release of chemical signals

- ***[[microglia]]***
  - the defense neuron, they make up too 20% of ***gilal cells***
  - they constantly seek out infectious invaders and absorb and destroy them to prevent disease and inflammation

### Synaptic Transmission: Chemical Signaling in the Brain
***[[neurotransmission]]***
- the ways neurons in the nervous system communicate with each other, through chemical means
  - neuron transmitters releases chemicals from the ***presynaptic cell***, and by diffusing the ***post-synaptic cell*** can notice the change in chemical concentration.
    - this neuron transmission is a one way process
- ***[[synaptic clef]]*** is the space between the ***pre-synaptic and post-synaptic cell***, that is 20-50nanometers small.
   - due to its size it can quickly change in neurotransmitter concentration
- ***[[synaptic vesicles]]***
- inside the membrane ***pre-synaptic cell*** the neurotransmitter molecules are packed into ***synaptic vesicles*** 
- the synaptic vesicles fuse into the cellular wall of the ***pre-synaptic cell***, neurotransmitter molecules then float in the synaptic cleft and are recieved by receptors in the ***postsynaptic neuron***

### Signaling
- the chemical reactions of Na+ and K+ ion, sends signals to start the process of neuron transmission.
- 
1. Resting 
- a sustained low levels of action potential
2. Threshold (action potential rises)
- the channels for Na+ start to open
3. Depolarization (action potential peaks)
- more Na+ channels start to open, reaches near climax of + Na ions
4. Repolarization (rapid decrease in action potential)
- Potassium (K+) ions channels open to let K+ out
5. Absolute Refractory Period
- Na+ channels close and K+ channels start to close,
- starts the process of turn the neuron back to regular levels


 ### types of neurotransmitters
 - neurotransmitters typically fall under categories 


***[[acetycholine]]***
- in ***Loewi's*** experiment he found the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine
  - this molecule is a excitatory neurotransmitter in the peripheral nervous system and causes muscle contractions at the junction between nervous systems and the muscle system

***[[monoamines]]***
the following are also known as catecholamines
- typically larger side of molecules
- dopamine
- epinephrine
- norepinephrine
- serotonin
- melatonin  

***[[amino acids]]***
- much smaller than ***monoamines***, they are the building blocks of proteins
***[[glutamate]]***
- a excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system
***[[aspartate]]***
- another excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter
***[[GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)]]*** and ***[[glycine]]***
- are hibitory neurotransmitters 


### Circuits - Neural Networks

***[[popultation coding]]***
- a population of neurons being stimulated at once to illisute a response

***[[sparse coding]]***
- a specific pattern of neuron within a greater population, that triggers a specific response
  - different pattern are responsible for specific triggers, (e.g, different faces will have different neural patterns)



### active recall questions:
- explain post-synaptic potentials, EPSP and IPSP
- what is temporal summation?
- what is spatial summation?
- why do temporal and spatial summation's occur in the soma or axon hillock?
- how does threshold, action potential relate to voltage gated ion channels
- explain concentration gradient and electrical gradient?
- how does the exchange of ions cause an action potential?
- why do action potentials only travel foreword and not backward?
- how does salatory conduction work, why does it decrease the travel time?
- what happens once the action potential reaches the axon terminals?
- what triggers the release of vesicles? And what happens when they are released?
- how do we link spikes and stimuli?
- what is rate coding?
- why do single spikes not illicit a neural response?
- what is the problem with train spikes and rate coding?
- explain local coding and its problems.
- explain population coding.
