 # [[Real imaginary numbers]]

### TLDR;
- a new system of numbers that allow us to solve equations that couldn't be solved by a single number system, as many equations solutions are non real numbers.

### proof
- since $i$ has a value $i=\sqrt{-1}$, using [[Real Numbers]]'s we can create [[Real imaginary numbers]].
- previous unquantifiable/[[imaginary numbers]] numbers such as $\sqrt{-9}, \sqrt{-5}$ can be simplified using [[Real imaginary numbers]].

$\sqrt{-9} = 3i$
$\sqrt{-5} = i\sqrt{5}$

> $\sqrt{-9} = 3i$
> the square root of 9 is 3,
> so the square root of -9 is 3 *imaginary units* or $3i$
> the property of this can be simplified as 
> $For \ a>,\ \sqrt{-a}=i\sqrt{a}$

### simplify $\sqrt{25}$
$=i\sqrt{25}$
$=5i$
