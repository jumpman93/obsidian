 # [[Chapter 4. Velocity and Acceleration and Differential Calculus]]

### lecture outline / learning goals:
1. previously we only looked at how forces acted on static vectors in equilibrium, [[differential calculus]] tries to find how a small change in the independent variable changes the dependent variable
2. the [[derivative]] should be thought of the quantity that approximated the change in the function.

### examples:

### active recall study questions:
- how do tangent line slopes and derivatives related?
