 # [[adaptive coding]]

### TLDR;
- adaptive coding allows the brain to allocate resources to different motor or sensory functions depending on how useful they are.
	- someone becoming more proficient at the violin will see a increase in finger representation on a cortical map. 
		- in rehab, paralyzed limbs can gain more function through deliberate usage of that limb and restraining the working limb, constraint therapy. Not using the working hand prevents the working hands neural mapping from taking over the weaker hand.
