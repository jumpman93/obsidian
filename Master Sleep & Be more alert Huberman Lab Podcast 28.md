# Circadian Rhythm and Chemicals
- the internal clock governs when our body wants to sleep.
- getting light information at proper times throughout the morning and night help anchor the [[circadian rhythm]] and the proper timings of hormonal releases that dictate sleep and waking.
- following proper sleep protocols will reset your [[circadian rhythm]] after a couple days.

### The morning
- when you wake up your [[adrenal glands]] release a hormone called [[cortisol]] and [[epinephrine]], signaling the body that it is time to start moving.
- cellular timers start when you wake up signaling the [[pineal gland]] too release [[melatonin]], which makes you sleepy.
- when light reaches your [[retinal ganglion cells]] in the eyes, an electrical signal is passed to the central clock called the [[superchiasmastic nucleus]] that connects to every cell and organ in the body
- the neurons that signal to the rest of the body to start the rhythm of waking up respond to a quality of light. Light from the sunrise has a different quality that sunlight over head, timing this initial exposure to light in the morning to pulse [[cortisol]] throughout out your body earlier. 
- multiple studies indicate that physically going out side from 5-60minutes (depending on the amount of light), will start the processes that govern your circadian rhythm and the hormonal release within your body.
- receiving [[cortisol]] pulses later in the day are linked with increase mental health problems and anxiety.
- timing this exposure to light is important 

### The night
- physically seeing sunlight during sunset is important for anchoring your [[circadian rhythm]], and helps the negate the negative affects of light after sunset.
- minimizing your light exposure past 8pm and especially between 11pm and 4am. A paper published in Cell shows that exposure to light between 11pm and 4am, suppresses the release of [[dopamine]], a [[neuromodulator]] that is required for making us feel good and an endogenous antidepressant. This inhibits learning and creating other detrimental effects. The light to the eyes signals a structure called the [[habenula]], (that sits in the [[thalamus]]) that makes us less happy and more prone to disappointment, leading to forms of depression when wakeful.

### Waking up earlier
- exposure to light before you wake up will help you wake up.
