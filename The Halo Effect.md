 # [[The Halo Effect]]

### TLDR;
- our past association and feeling of things influences the way we make decisions in the future.
- eg; if you meet someone named Janet at a party and find that you enjoy spending time with her and find her attractive. Later in the week you are asked if you think Janet would donate to charity. Based upon your impression of Janet you are likely to say she would. Although you don't know this aspect of Janet you will build new narratives about her character without knowing them based on the assumption that you have of her.
